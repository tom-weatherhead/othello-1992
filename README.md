# othello-1992
My first implementation of the game of Othello (Reversi).

This program can be compiled with gcc using the following command:

  gcc othello.c -o othello.exe

It can then be executed via:

  ./othello.exe

This program was tested in April 2016 on Ubuntu 16.04, and on Windows 10 using [Scoop](http://scoop.sh/) (gcc can be obtained by installing Scoop's Perl package).
